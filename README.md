# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my personal Advent of Code 2024 repository! This is where I will be documenting and sharing my solutions to the daily coding challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun with the coding community.

## Structure

Each day, a new folder will be created with the following structure:
```
/day
    ├── input.txt
    ├── part1.py
    └── part2.py
```

- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for the day.
- `part1.py`: My solution for part 1 of the day's puzzle.
- `part2.py`: My solution for part 2 of the day's puzzle.


Happy coding!
